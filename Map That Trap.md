# Map That Trap

This tool advances the accuracy and depth of the city's knowledge of vacant and abandoned buildings. It allows residents and community organizations to submit reports of abandoned buildings to the Chicago Police Department and the City of Chicago's 311 System, while simultaneously adding to Map That Trap's database, allowing it to be the city's most comprehensive database of abandoned, vacant and troubled buildings.

Map That Trap will first aggregate existing sources of vacant and abandoned buildings including the 311 system, Chicago Data Portal Building Violations list and HUD's aggregation of vacancies from the United States Postal Service.

It will then allow easy submission of building addresses to the Chicago Police Department, via the ClearPath Community Concerns API, and to Chicago's Troubled Buildings Initiative.

Because these databases are closed, each submission will also be forked into the public Map That Trap website.

Residents and community organizations will be able to submit new data by using the LocalData mobile input system that has already been used by the University of Chicago's South Side Health and Vitality Studies. Potential addresses will be checked immediately against the existing database, so that users do not waste time inputting additional information.

Potential data fields are:
- Address (will match to building footprint data)
- Empty building
- Windows not secured
- Gang activity
- Boarded
- Fly dumping
- Apparently abandoned

Submitters will have an option to upload a photo for that address.

Alternatively, a paper worksheet for each area could be filled by neighborhood canvassers and then hand-keyed into the system.

The system will use building footprint data to structure submissions in an accurate and reliable way. It will also support creation of maps and user-defined target areas to support surveying efforts.**Â 
By providing a timestamp and submitter identification, Map That Trap will also help allow data submitters to qualify for a percentage of payments for any fines or judgments against the building's owner, under Municipal Code 13-12-125, et. seq.

Submissions to the site will require basic login at the minimum. Additional information could be voluntarily submitted to support city evaluation of the program and local community organizing.
