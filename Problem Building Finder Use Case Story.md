# Problem Building Finder Use Case Story 

Chicago currently has hundreds of an abandoned and vacant buildings. These buildings become magnets for community issues such as drugs, crime, and are potential fire hazards. 

The City's 311 system makes it simple for residents to report abandoned buildings, however - the 311 request form doesn't generate a community concern report to the Chicago Police Department. 

Using the new ClearPath API, this app will help report abandoned buildings to both CLEARpath and alert the Chicago Police Department about a potential problem. 

## Use Case One: 

Logan is a community organizer in the Englewood neighborhood. Logans organization wants to ensure that the Chicago Police know where all the abandoned buildings are in order to help reduce violence in the neighborhood. 

Logan goes to the Problem Building Finder system and pulls up a list of buildings for his neighborhood. Logan then moves through the lists and marks down which buildings he knows are known problems. As he annoates the list, the system then sends this information to CPD ClearPath System. 

## Use Case Two: 

Logan then takes a walk around the neighborhood to make sure that the group didn't miss any buildings. He comes across a building not on the list. Using the system's intergration with LocalData, Logan fills out information about the building into the site's mobile web page.

LocalData's system then exports that information to the Problem Building Finder and the report is then routed to the Chicago Police Department through the CLEARpath API.
